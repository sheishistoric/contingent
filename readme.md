# Contingent Magazine

Contingent Magazine is our idea for a nonprofit online magazine driven by people’s desire to understand the past and, inevitably, themselves. We have a threefold mission which can be broken down into the magazine’s creators, content, and audience:

Our creators will largely be historians working outside the tenure-track professoriate—those hired on a course-by-course or year-to-year basis, working in public history, or not working in a history-related field at all
Our content will be ethically produced, rigorous, and accessible to the public
Our audience will be those who have a deep love for and interest in the past but are often not catered to
